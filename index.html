        <h1>QuizNova - Privacy Policy</h1>

        <p><b>Last Updated: 29.05.2025</b></p>

        <p>MindosTech ("us", "we", or "our") operates the QuizNova mobile application (the "Service"). This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our Service and the choices you have associated with that data.</p>

        <p>By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>

        <h2>1. Information Collection and Use</h2>
        <p>QuizNova does not directly collect any personally identifiable information (PII) from its users (e.g., name, email address, location). The application functions locally on your device and does not require you to submit personal data.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Quiz Data:</b> Quiz questions and categories are fetched from the Open Trivia Database (https://opentdb.com), a publicly available API. Your quiz progress, selected answers, and scores are stored locally on your device only. This data is not transmitted to us or any third parties.</li>
            <li><b>Theme Preferences:</b> Your chosen application theme (Light/Dark) is stored locally on your device.</li>
            <li><b>Automatically Collected Information (for Advertisements):</b> Our Service uses Google AdMob to display advertisements. Google AdMob may collect anonymous data (such as advertising ID, device type, non-precise location, etc.) to serve interest-based advertisements. For more information on how Google uses data when you use our partners' sites or apps, please visit <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google's Privacy & Terms page</a>. You may have options to limit or opt-out of personalized advertising through your device settings.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>We do not share any data we collect or that is stored on your device with third parties, other than as described above for Google AdMob.</p>

        <h2>3. Data Retention and Security</h2>
        <p>All data, such as your quiz progress and theme preferences, is stored solely on your device. The security of this data depends on the overall security of your device. As we do not store any user data on our servers, the risk of a data breach from our side is minimal.</p>

        <h2>4. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us.</p>

        <h2>5. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>

        <h2>6. Contact Us</h2>
